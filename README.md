Gg â€” Basic types and tools for computer graphics in OCaml
=========================================================
%%VERSION%%

Gg provides basic types for computer graphics. It defines types and
functions for floats, vectors, points, sizes, matrices, quaternions,
axis-aligned boxes, colors, color spaces, and raster data.

On top of this the Gg_kit library provides a few more tools and
algorithms for working with geometry and graphics.

Gg and Gg_kit are distributed under the ISC license. They have
no dependencies.

# Installation

Gg can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install gg

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions and a complete specification of the dependencies.

# Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc gg`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum] than on
the issue tracker.

A few basic sample programs can be found in the [`test`](test/)
directory.
