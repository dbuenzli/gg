description: """\
Gg provides basic types for computer graphics. It defines types and
functions for floats, vectors, points, sizes, matrices, quaternions,
axis-aligned boxes, colors, color spaces, and raster data.

On top of this the Gg_kit library provides a few more tools and
algorithms for working with geometry and graphics.

Gg and Gg_kit have no dependencies. Gg is distributed under the ISC
license. Gg_kit is distributed under the ISC license and some color
schemes are distributed under the Apache 2.0 and CC0 licenses.
